# case-converter
Converts an input text to several formats.

This is a simple project to understand a little better about regular expressions and string/array manipulation.

## Options
- Sentence case
- lower case
- UPPER CASE
- Title Case
- aLtErNaTiNg CaSe
- InVeRsE CaSe
- Download

## Improvements
Still needs to transform all "I"s to upper case in the "Sentence case" option.
